            <p>Black eye coffee also called a double shot in the dark, is a coffee drink that is gaining in popularity, especially amongst students. It is a unique combination of coffee and espresso, which creates a drink with a high intensity of flavor, and more importantly extra caffeine.</p>

            <h1>Flat White</h1>
            <p>A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam (steamed milk with small, fine bubbles and a glossy or velvety consistency). It is comparable to a latte, but smaller in volume and with less microfoam, therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk, and milk that is more velvety in consistency – allowing the espresso to dominate the flavour, while being supported by the milk.</p>

            <p>A latte or caffè latte is a milk coffee that is a made up of one or two shots of espresso, steamed milk and a final, thin layer of frothed milk on top. If you don't drink dairy milk, you can easily swap it for a plant-based alternative like soy, oat or coconut milk.</p>
